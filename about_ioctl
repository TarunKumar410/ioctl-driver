ioctl stands for input output control. It is a system call. The major use of this is handling some specific operations of a device for which the kernel does not have a system call by default.
The ioctl function is useful for implementing a device driver to set the configuration on the device. 
eg: a printer that has configuration options to check and set the font family, font size etc. ioctl could be used to get the current font as well as set the font to a new one. A user application uses ioctl to send a code to a printer telling it to return the current font or to set the font to a new one.
